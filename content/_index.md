        I'm a UK-based Social Sciences researcher with experience in academia and government.  
        I specialise in Comparative Politics and Latin America, with broader expertise in post-transition regions and UK politics.  
        My work bridges research and teaching, with a focus on inclusive, student-centred learning.  
        I value collaboration, public engagement, and contribute to dynamic academic networks and environments.  
        I am open to collaboration.
