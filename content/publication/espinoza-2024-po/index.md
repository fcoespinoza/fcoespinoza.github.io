abstract: Variations in political participation are linked to demographic factors,
  socioeconomic disparities, and cultural-ethnic diversity. Existing research has
  primarily explored reduced political involvement among individuals with disabilities,
  particularly in electoral politics. However, little research has attended the involvement
  of deaf people specifically. This is of interest because deaf youth are at an intersection
  of disability, language and cultural identity with their language affiliations and
  rejection or acceptance of disability evolving through childhood. This study draws
  from original data collected via an online survey, comprising 163 deaf young respondents
  aged 16-19 in Great Britain. We compare their levels of political participation
  with those of general population peers to explore how sociodemographic factors,
  alongside variations in self-identification as deaf, and meaningful interactions
  with other deaf people contribute to explain their political engagement. The results
  challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that deaf youth participate more
  actively in politics than their hearing peers in various forms of political involvement,
  including collective, contact, and institutional activism. We also recognize differences
  among deaf youth and propose that social aspects of identity formation, particularly
  embracing a deaf identity and having deaf friends, can boost certain forms of political
  engagement. In summary, this study underscores the importance of acknowledging the
  diversity of deaf youth in terms of affiliation with various forms of deaf identity,
  rendering their experience different from both disabled and hearing youth. By identifying
  the factors driving heightened political participation, policymakers and advocates
  can develop strategies to enhance political engagement among all young people, regardless
  of their hearing status.
