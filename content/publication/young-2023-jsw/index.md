abstract: Summary This article concerns interpreter-mediated Mental Health Act (MHA)
  (1983) assessments where either a signed or spoken language interpreter is required.
  It reports data from 132 Approved Mental Health Professionals (AMHPs) in England
  who have direct experience of such circumstances addressing expertise, training,
  readiness, and potential influences on the outcome when interpreters are involved.
  Quantitative data were collected by means of an online survey analyzed descriptively
  with additional open-ended qualitative responses analyzed thematically. Findings
  More interpreter-mediated MHA assessments were reported as occurring in hospital
  than in community settings. Although AMHPs were confident in their expertise, nearly
  two-thirds felt they were less effective when an interpreter was involved. The vast
  majority had received only minimal training on how to work with an interpreter.
  Recording of language and interpreter use in the assessment was revealed as inconsistent.
  Most AMHPs thought incorrectly that interpreters were subject to mandatory registration
  with assured minimum standards of qualification and expertise. Practical problems
  associated with the timeliness of access to interpreters and complexities of using
  telephone interpreters instead of face to face were raised. AMHPs expressed a wish
  for more training and guidance including expectations of the interpreter role. Applications
  Consistent standards of formal recording of interpreter use as part of annual monitoring
  of the MHA are required to understand any potential inequities of outcome resulting
  from language mediation. Joint training with interpreters is desirable with more
  specific guidance and resources for working AMHPs and interpreters to promote best
  practice.
