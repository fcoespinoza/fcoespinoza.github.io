abstract: This article concerns online data capture using survey methods when the
  target population(s) comprise not just of several different language-using groups,
  but additionally populations who may be multilingual and whose total language repertoires
  are commonly employed in meaning-making practices---commonly referred to as translanguaging.
  It addresses whether current online data capture survey methods adequately respond
  to such population characteristics and demonstrates a worked example of how we adapted
  one electronic data capture software platform (REDCap) to present participants with
  not just multilingual but translanguaging engagement routes that also encompassed
  multimodal linguistic access in auditory, orthographic, and visual media. The study
  population comprised deaf young people. We share the technical (coding) adaptations
  made and discuss the relevance of our work for other linguistic populations.
