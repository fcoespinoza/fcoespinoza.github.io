abstract: READY is a self-report prospective longitudinal study of deaf and hard of
  hearing (DHH) young people aged 16 to 19 years on entry. Its overarching aim is
  to explore the risk and protective factors for successful transition to adulthood.
  This article introduces the cohort of 163 DHH young people, background characteristics
  and study design. Focusing on self-determination and subjective well-being only,
  those who completed the assessments in written English (n,=~133) score significantly
  lower than general population comparators. Sociodemographic variables explain very
  little of the variance in well-being scores; higher levels of self-determination
  are a predictor of higher levels of well-being, outweighing the influence of any
  background characteristics. Although women and those who are LGBTQ+ have statistically
  significantly lower well-being scores, these aspects of their identity are not predictive
  risk factors. These results add to the case for self-determination interventions
  to support better well-being amongst DHH young people.
