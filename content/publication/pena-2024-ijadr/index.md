abstract: Background. Local governments have a crucial role to play in alcohol control
  policies. However, there is a lack of descriptions of comprehensive intersectoral
  alcohol control strategies led by them. The study describes the experience of developing
  and implementing an intersectoral alcohol strategy in the Municipality of Santiago,
  Chile, between 2014-2017. ~ Methods. We used a case study design. We used data from
  municipal documents, including reports from fee agreements, official sources of
  information, municipal service calls and police records, georeferenced data on alcohol
  outlets and photographs of storefront signs. We used data from interviews with community
  stakeholders and municipal workers conducted during the study period. ~ Results.
  The first stage (2014-2015) consisted of using local evidence to build political
  will. The main activities were introducing screening and brief alcohol interventions
  in high schools, supporting a public consultation on reducing the opening hours
  of liquor stores, and introducing economic incentives to reduce street-level alcohol
  marketing. The second stage (2015-2017) included a community-action pilot plan and
  the development and implementation of an intersectoral alcohol control plan involving
  twelve municipal departments. Activities aimed at reducing the number of alcohol
  outlets, enhancing transparency on alcohol licensing procedures, and improving the
  quality of brief interventions. The strategy implemented actions in nine out of
  ten WHO Alcohol Policy domains. ~ Conclusions. The experience of Santiago demonstrates
  the untapped potential for alcohol control at the local level. Political will, local
  evidence, sharing common goals and medium-term budget frameworks are important facilitators
  of comprehensive intersectoral alcohol interventions.
