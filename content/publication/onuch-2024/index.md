abstract: The MOBILISE project examines why some people respond to discontent by protesting,
  others by migrating while yet others stay immobile. It focuses on four countries
  that have seen outmigration and protest in recent year (Ukraine, Poland, Morocco
  and Argentina) and migrants from these countries who live in Germany, the United
  Kingdom and Spain. The main body of MOBILISE survey data are nationally representative
  face-to-face surveys in Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Argentina. All of the surveys
  thoroughly ask for political views and beliefs as well as socio economic background,
  the reasons and motivations to (or not) migrate and the reason to (or not) protest.
  The  surveys were run face to face CAPI and following the onset of the COVID-19
  pandemic the mode shifted to CATI. The MOBILISE national and migrant surveys (found
  in separate depository) are set-up as a two wave panel. The first wave of data collection
  for the migrant and national survey started in March 2019 and finished in March
  2020. The second wave started between December 2020 and December 2021.  Where possible
  we also collected Online Protest Surveys employing the same questionnaires as the
  Nationally Representative Panel Surveys and Migrant Surveys. Online Protest Surveys
  were collected in Belarus in 2020 and Poland in 2020/2021. This data deposit contains
  wave one and two of the nationally representative panel surveys in Argentina, Ukraine,
  and Poland as well as the Online Protest Surveys were collected in Belarus in 2020
  and Poland in 2020/2021. (the Moroccan surveys and the migrant surveys are deposited
  separately please contact the MOBILISE Dutch and French PIs for these data).
