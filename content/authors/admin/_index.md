## About Me

Francisco Espinoza holds a PhD in Politics from The University of Manchester, UK, where he is currently a Lecturer in Politics. He also earned a Master’s degree in Political Science and a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the University of Chile. His doctoral research used cross-sectional survey data and subnational economic series to examine how subnational, social, and gender inequalities influence the relationship between economic conditions and electoral behaviour across Latin America. His academic experience includes roles as a research associate and research assistant on longitudinal survey projects and comparative studies.
