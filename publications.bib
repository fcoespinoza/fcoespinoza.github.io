  abstract = {Variations in political participation are linked to demographic factors, socioeconomic disparities, and cultural-ethnic diversity. Existing research has primarily explored reduced political involvement among individuals with disabilities, particularly in electoral politics. However, little research has attended the involvement of deaf people specifically. This is of interest because deaf youth are at an intersection of disability, language and cultural identity with their language affiliations and rejection or acceptance of disability evolving through childhood. This study draws from original data collected via an online survey, comprising 163 deaf young respondents aged 16-19 in Great Britain. We compare their levels of political participation with those of general population peers to explore how sociodemographic factors, alongside variations in self-identification as deaf, and meaningful interactions with other deaf people contribute to explain their political engagement. The results challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that deaf youth participate more actively in politics than their hearing peers in various forms of political involvement, including collective, contact, and institutional activism. We also recognize differences among deaf youth and propose that social aspects of identity formation, particularly embracing a deaf identity and having deaf friends, can boost certain forms of political engagement. In summary, this study underscores the importance of acknowledging the diversity of deaf youth in terms of affiliation with various forms of deaf identity, rendering their experience different from both disabled and hearing youth. By identifying the factors driving heightened political participation, policymakers and advocates can develop strategies to enhance political engagement among all young people, regardless of their hearing status.},

It focuses on four countries that have seen outmigration and protest in recent year (Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Argentina) and migrants from these countries who live in Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. The main body of MOBILISE survey data are nationally representative face-to-face surveys in Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Argentina. All of the surveys thoroughly ask for political views and beliefs as well as socio economic background, the reasons and motivations to (or not) migrate and the reason to (or not) protest. The  surveys were run face to face CAPI and following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the mode shifted to CATI. The MOBILISE national and migrant surveys (found in separate depository) are set-up as a two wave panel. The first wave of data collection for the migrant and national survey started in March 2019 and finished in March 2020. The second wave started between December 2020 and December 2021.  Where possible we also collected Online Protest Surveys employing the same questionnaires as the Nationally Representative Panel Surveys and Migrant Surveys. Online Protest Surveys were collected in Belarus in 2020 and Poland in 2020/2021. This data deposit contains wave one and two of the nationally representative panel surveys in Argentina, Ukraine, and Poland as well as the Online Protest Surveys were collected in Belarus in 2020 and Poland in 2020/2021.

  abstract = {Background. Local governments have a crucial role to play in alcohol control policies. However, there is a lack of descriptions of comprehensive intersectoral alcohol control strategies led by them. The study describes the experience of developing and implementing an intersectoral alcohol strategy in the Municipality of Santiago, Chile, between 2014-2017. ~ Methods. We used a case study design. We used data from municipal documents, including reports from fee agreements, official sources of information, municipal service calls and police records, georeferenced data on alcohol outlets and photographs of storefront signs. We used data from interviews with community stakeholders and municipal workers conducted during the study period. ~ Results. The first stage (2014-2015) consisted of using local evidence to build political will. The main activities were introducing screening and brief alcohol interventions in high schools, supporting a public consultation on reducing the opening hours of liquor stores, and introducing economic incentives to reduce street-level alcohol marketing. The second stage (2015-2017) included a community-action pilot plan and the development and implementation of an intersectoral alcohol control plan involving twelve municipal departments. Activities aimed at reducing the number of alcohol outlets, enhancing transparency on alcohol licensing procedures, and improving the quality of brief interventions. The strategy implemented actions in nine out of ten WHO Alcohol Policy domains. ~ Conclusions. The experience of Santiago demonstrates the untapped potential for alcohol control at the local level. Political will, local evidence, sharing common goals and medium-term budget frameworks are important facilitators of comprehensive intersectoral alcohol interventions.},

  abstract = {Summary This article concerns interpreter-mediated Mental Health Act (MHA) (1983) assessments where either a signed or spoken language interpreter is required. It reports data from 132 Approved Mental Health Professionals (AMHPs) in England who have direct experience of such circumstances addressing expertise, training, readiness, and potential influences on the outcome when interpreters are involved. Quantitative data were collected by means of an online survey analyzed descriptively with additional open-ended qualitative responses analyzed thematically. Findings More interpreter-mediated MHA assessments were reported as occurring in hospital than in community settings. Although AMHPs were confident in their expertise, nearly two-thirds felt they were less effective when an interpreter was involved. The vast majority had received only minimal training on how to work with an interpreter. Recording of language and interpreter use in the assessment was revealed as inconsistent. Most AMHPs thought incorrectly that interpreters were subject to mandatory registration with assured minimum standards of qualification and expertise. Practical problems associated with the timeliness of access to interpreters and complexities of using telephone interpreters instead of face to face were raised. AMHPs expressed a wish for more training and guidance including expectations of the interpreter role. Applications Consistent standards of formal recording of interpreter use as part of annual monitoring of the MHA are required to understand any potential inequities of outcome resulting from language mediation. Joint training with interpreters is desirable with more specific guidance and resources for working AMHPs and interpreters to promote best practice.},

Its overarching aim is to explore the risk and protective factors for successful transition to adulthood. This article introduces the cohort of 163 DHH young people, background characteristics and study design. Focusing on self-determination and subjective well-being only, those who completed the assessments in written English (n\,=~133) score significantly lower than general population comparators. Sociodemographic variables explain very little of the variance in well-being scores; higher levels of self-determination are a predictor of higher levels of well-being, outweighing the influence of any background characteristics. Although women and those who are LGBTQ+ have statistically significantly lower well-being scores, these aspects of their identity are not predictive risk factors. These results add to the case for self-determination interventions to support better well-being amongst DHH young people.},
